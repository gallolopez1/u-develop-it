# u-develop-it

## User Story
`U Develop It is starting a new fiscal year, and it's time to pick a new president. Of course, the group is developing its own app for voting. Some members have already started building the front end of the application, but they need volunteers to build the back end.

The back end will consist of a relational database behind an API. You already know how to create an API with Express.js, so you've volunteered to join the back-end development team. This will be a great opportunity to learn about databases!`

## Instructions
By the end, you'll accomplish the following:

* Use MySQL to create a database.

* Use SQL to create and populate a table of data.

* Run SQL queries to create, read, update, and delete data from a table.

## Built With
* JS
* MySQL
